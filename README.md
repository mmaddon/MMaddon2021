    In summary, the current software did not have the basic ability to have one or more teams involved. The users/staff
  members requiring such involvement wanted each team to have multiple players assigned to it. In the Gaming Room
  program, the clients were the users/staff members of The Gaming Room Team. They wanted to implement game and
  team names in the program, and it must be distinctive to allow users to check whether a name is in usage when
  deciding on a team name. They required the stipulation that only one occurrence of the game can exist in memory at
  any given time. This was accomplished by creating unique accessories for each setting of a game, team, or player.
  This was made possible by either utilizing IntelliJ or Eclipse in order to complete what necessary to have a
  complete,finished product. 
    Finding information was probably the easiest part on describing what was necessary to complete this project. Also
  finishing the possible constraints and completeing the architectural view was not as challenging as the completion
  of the code. I had a very difficult time with contriving the necessary context on completing and testing the code and
  will need more practice in the future.  The design document was helpful because it took a further breakdown of what
  was required in completing the project and being able to describe what was necessary, but staying away from
  becoming esoteric. 
    On revitilizing a part of the completed documentation, there could be more information given on the development 
  requirements.  If I was part of a team, I would have that part become into a group discussion so that there could be
  more ideas on what was required on different operating systems and used more context.  On taking the interpretation of 
  what was required from the user's needs, I had what was needed written down as a platform in being able to complete what
  was asked for.  It is extremely important to be able to know exactly what the user/staff member requires because even the 
  slightest deviation no matter how insignificant can deter the user to want to either pay for the work done or
  discontinue the possibility of futuristic business with the team.  
     The software program that was utilizing in completing the program was IntelliJ.  I would futuristically recommend
  IntelliJ over Eclipse because I believe IntelliJ is easier to follow and gives suggestions to complete said project.
